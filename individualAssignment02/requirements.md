# Individual Assignment 2: The Record Store

For this assignment, you will be creating a web site for a fictional record store.  This assignment will emphasize your use of various techniques that we've learned for arranging various elements on the screen.

## Requirements

1. Use CSS Flexible Layout (e.g. "Flexbox") in order to prominently display five featured albums on your page horizontally.  You should define the appearance of these items using the following properties:
   - flex-direction
   - flex-wrap
   - justify-content
   - align-items

2. When the user hovers over one of these featured records, move that record vertically lower and make it become larger.

3. Create an HTML table that displays your inventory.  Use table headers as shown in class to add the following columns to your table:
   - Artist Name
   - Album Name
   - Price\
Add information for at least 5 records to your table.

4. Create an additional HTML page that contains information about your record store. Use float to offset some portion of the page from the rest of your text.  Use absolute and relative positioning somewhere on this page.

5. Create a navigation menu to navigate between the two pages.

6. Use an HTML footer element as shown in class to provide some contact information about the store.  Use your CSS file to style the footer differently from the rest of the page.

## Bonus

For 3 points of extra credit, display information about the record that was not previously visible when the user hovers over it.
