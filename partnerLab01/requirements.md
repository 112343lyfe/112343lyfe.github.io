## Goal

Create a properly formatted and styled website that demonstrates your understanding of topics discussed in class. Your site should have a purpose such as advertising a brand (either real or fictional), teaching a skill, or providing useful information.

### Description

You may choose the content of your website, but you should make sure that your site meets all of the following requirements:

- [x] Create three HTML pages.  Each page should have a purpose within the context of your overall site.
- [x] Create at least one CSS file that provides styling for all three of your HTML pages.
- [x] One of your pages should have a floating element that includes both text and an image.  It should have proper margins.  Other text should wrap around that floating element.
- [x] Use Google Fonts.
- [x] Use span and div as shown in class.
- [x] Modify background and foreground colors of at least one element using hexadecimal values from CSS.
- [x] Apply a CSS style to an entire web page using a single CSS selector.
- [x] Use a CSS class selector to apply a style to multiple page elements.
- [x] Use a CSS hover selector to make something happen when the user places their mouse pointer over an element.
