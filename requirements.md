# Practice Activity 4

- [ ] Host your complete portfolio on a web hosting server.
- [ ] Your portfolio must have a front page with links and one screenshot of each of your class assignments (3 practice activities, 2 partner labs, and 4 individual assignments). 
- [ ] Each assignment website must be placed in its own folder and must have a link to go back to the main page (you can create a navigation bar on top of the main page of every assignment website).
- [ ] Make the front page look very attractive and professional since it is the cover page of your web development portfolio.

Note: Although we haven't created Individual assignment 4 (final project), please include a link to an "under construction" index.html page within a separate folder so you can upload your final project there when you finish it.
