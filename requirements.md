# Individual Assignment 4 (Final Project)

The goal of this assignment is to create a multi-page website that informs the reader about some topic that you are knowledgeable about or interested in.  You have a great deal of flexibility with regard to the content of this website (but please keep it appropriate for all audiences).

You are encouraged to go above and beyond the minimum requirements. This is your final project and it must show the best of your abilities. If you just do the minimum, you won´t get full marks.

Minimum Requirements:

- [ ] Your website should render correctly without any syntactical or usage errors, and it should have generally good appearance, function properly, and convey information in an effective manner. I will be using the Chrome browser to evaluate it.
- [ ] Your website should include at least five web pages. You should have at least five html files, but they may share common CSS and/or JavaScript files.
- [ ] Your website should make effective use of the following HTML elements:
  - [x] Paragraphs
  - [x] Divs or spans
  - [x] Lists (ordered or unordered)
  - [x] At least one image
  - [ ] At least one table
  - [ ] An HTML footer with fixed positioning on each page
  - [ ] A contact form that displays a message when submitted
  - [ ] Either a menu or hyperlinks connecting each of your pages (navigation bar).
- [ ] Your website should make effective use of the following CSS capabilities:
  - [ ] Applying styles to your entire web page
  - [ ] Applying styles by class
  - [ ] Applying styles by ID
  - [ ] Applying styles using pseudoclasses (ie. link, visited, hover, active, etc)
  - [ ] Performing layout with CSS Grid or Flexbox
  - [ ] Appying transforms and filters
  - [ ] Applying positioning (ie. to the elements in the contact form)
  - [ ] Appying Bootstrap styles (ie. to the contact form)
