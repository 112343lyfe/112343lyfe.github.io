# Practice Activity 3

As we learned in class, there are various ways of creating a Bootstrap web page.  You may start from scratch, or start by using one of the starter example (diferent to Carousel) sites found here: [starter examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/examples)

For this practice activity, you will browse through the starter Examples at the link above, and modify the example to display content of your choice.

Note: While this is intended to be a relatively quick Practice Activity, please be sure to fully customize the starter example.  For example, if you extend the "Blog" starter Example, there should not be any page elements in your submitted assignment that say "Blog title here" or similar place holders.
