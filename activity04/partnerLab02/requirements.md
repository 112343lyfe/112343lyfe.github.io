# Partner Lab 2: An interactive website

## Goal

Use JavaScript to create an interactive website that allows the user to customize the page that they view.

----

1. Create an HTML page that contains a user greeting (e.g. "Hello User!") inside an \<h1> element and a brief message inside a \<p> element.
2. Further down the page, add the following properly labelled page elements that will allow the user to customize the greeting and brief message created in Step 1:
   1. A text box for the user to enter their name (to customize the greeting)
   2. A text box for the user to enter the brief message to be displayed inside of the \<p> element created in step 1.
   3. A drop down menu that allows the user to choose the background color of the page from several options.
   4. A submit button that puts these changes into effect.
3. Create a JavaScript file that updates the user greeting, brief message, and background color of the page based on the options that the user selects when the button is clicked.  Remember to link your JavaScript file to your HTML file.
4. Create a CSS file that adds styling to your page.

## Extra Credit (up to 3 points)

- Add "To Do List" functionality that allows the user to add "To Do" items using an additional text box and button.  Each "To Do" item should be stored as a list item inside of an ordered list.
